## Plan on improving the project

Project Name: Shivakaahini Coffee shop

I would like to add more tools which will be easily predicted to apply for the properities easily and also it can recommand some of the properities which has to be applied.

I thoroughly enjoyed by encountering the errors which I made during this project and also we could have worked more on styling the webpage on our own. I learnt more things in this Sprint 2.
